title: "Dichotomy in Open Scholarship Use by Nigerian and Foreign authors in a Low Resource Context: A Content Analysis of Publications on Natural Language Processing of Nigerian Languages"
abstract: "Full texts of the NLP of Nigerian languages’ papers were systematically retrieved from Google, Web of Science and Scopus for analysis. The result of the analysis shows that foreign authored papers (80.4%) published their articles in at least one non-commercial repository, more than local authored papers (55.3%). While 19.1% of the foreign authored papers published their datasets, none of the local authored papers did. While 10.4% of the foreign authored papers published their computer codes, none of the local authored papers did. This suggests that Nigerian researchers do not employ the open scholarship for research as much as their foreign counterparts."
